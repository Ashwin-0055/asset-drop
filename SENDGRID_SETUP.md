## üîç Troubleshooting

### Error: "Sender email not verified"

**Problem:** The SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL is not verified in SendGrid.

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders
2. Make sure your email shows "Verified" status (green checkmark)
3. Check your inbox for verification email if pending
4. Make sure SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL in Vercel matches exactly

### Error: "Email service not configured"

**Problem:** Environment variables are not set in Vercel.

**Solution:**
1. Double-check you added all 3 environment variables (see Step 4)
2. Make sure you selected all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
3. Trigger a new deployment after adding env vars
4. Check Vercel deployment logs for specific error

### Error: "Unauthorized" or "Invalid API Key"

**Problem:** The SENDGRID_API_KEY is incorrect or missing.

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
2. Create a new API key (you can't view old ones)
3. Update SENDGRID_API_KEY in Vercel with the new key
4. Redeploy

### Emails not being received

**Possible causes:**

1. **Check Spam/Junk folder** - SendGrid emails sometimes go to spam initially
2. **Verify sender email** - Make sure it's verified in SendGrid
3. **Check SendGrid Activity Feed:**
   - Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity
   - See if emails are being sent and their status
   - Look for bounces or blocks

4. **Check rate limits:**
   - Free tier: 100 emails/day
   - If exceeded, emails won't send until next day

### SendGrid dashboard shows email sent but not received

1. Check recipient's spam/junk folder
2. Add sender email to recipient's contacts
3. Check SendGrid Activity Feed for delivery status
4. Some email providers (Gmail, Outlook) may delay delivery
