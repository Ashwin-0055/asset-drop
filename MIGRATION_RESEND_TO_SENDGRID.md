# Migration from Resend to SendGrid

## ✅ What Changed

Your app has been migrated from **Resend** to **SendGrid** for email notifications.

### Why the Switch?

**Resend Problem:**
- Required domain verification to send emails to any address
- Only worked with your registered email (hustlerashwin2400@gmail.com)
- Would need you to buy and verify a custom domain

**SendGrid Solution:**
- Send to **ANY email address** after simple email verification
- **No domain required** for basic use
- Just verify your email - takes 2 minutes!
- 100 free emails per day (vs needing paid domain)

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### 1. Create SendGrid Account (2 minutes)
- Go to: https://sendgrid.com/
- Sign up with: hustlerashwin2400@gmail.com
- Verify your account

### 2. Get API Key (1 minute)
- Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
- Create API key with "Full Access"
- Copy it (starts with `SG.`)

### 3. Verify Sender Email (2 minutes)
- Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders
- Click "Create New Sender"
- Use: hustlerashwin2400@gmail.com
- Check your inbox and click verification link

### 4. Add to Vercel (2 minutes)
- Vercel → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- Add:
  - `SENDGRID_API_KEY` = your API key
  - `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` = hustlerashwin2400@gmail.com
  - `SENDGRID_FROM_NAME` = AssetDrop (optional)

### 5. Deploy
- Push to GitHub (already done!)
- Vercel auto-deploys
- Done! 🎉

**Total time: ~10 minutes**
