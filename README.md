## 💡 The Problem

Creative agencies and freelancers waste **hours every week** managing client file submissions:

- 📧 Endless email threads with scattered attachments
- 💾 Files lost in spam folders or buried in inbox chaos
- 🔄 "Can you resend that file?" messages that never end
- 📁 Manual organizing of files into folders for each project
- ❌ No way to reject files or request revisions professionally
- 🤷 No visibility into what's been submitted or what's missing

**Result:** Frustrated clients, wasted time, and unprofessional workflows.
